# Ray Tracing Graphic Design Project

## Description
This project is a sophisticated Ray Tracing engine developed as part of the CSE386 Computer Graphics course at Miami University. The engine is capable of rendering realistic 3D scenes, incorporating advanced features such as lighting, shadows, reflections, texture mapping, and anti-aliasing. This project demonstrates the application of complex computer graphics techniques and provides a tool for visualizing various geometric transformations and material interactions under different lighting conditions.

## Features
- **Realistic 3D Rendering**: Models interactions of various 3D objects with dynamic lighting and shadows.
- **Advanced Graphics Techniques**:
  - **Reflections**: Implements reflections to enhance visual realism.
  - **Texture Mapping**: Supports texture mapping using PPM files.
  - **Transparency and Anti-aliasing**: Includes transparency effects and anti-aliasing to reduce visual artifacts.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Users can interact with the scene using predefined keystrokes to manipulate elements such as lighting and object positions.

## Built With
- C++
- OpenGL (for rendering context and handling graphics hardware)
- GLM (for mathematical operations in graphics)
- Visual Studio/XCode (IDE)

## Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (GCC or Clang)
- Visual Studio or any compatible IDE that supports C++ and OpenGL
- OpenGL setup on your machine

### Installation
1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
